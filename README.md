![Conceptual visualization of the proposed Deep Learning Framework for Sleep Stage Classification using Accelerometry and Photoplethysmography acquired from Consumer Sleep Technologies](/resources/images/model_ver15.png)
Conceptual representation of the proposed deep neural network (DNN) in an example recording. Two time-aligned spectrograms are firstly concatenated, reshaped, and zero-padded to conform to the subsequent temporal module. Then the segments are processed in the deep convolutional neural network, inspired by U-Net [^2], [^3], [^4] that consists of ùëÄ encoder and decoder blocks. Finally, the output is segmented into sleep epochs
of 30 s duration and classified into 4 classes: wake, light sleep, deep sleep. The classification module is inspired by the segment classifier from U-Sleep [^3]. The argmax of the model predictions is presented along with the ground truth hypnogram for comparison. Periods with data loss are labeled with mask. ùëÄ: Number of encoder and decoder blocks in U-net; ùëá: number of sleep epochs; ùëÅ: duration in seconds of the recording; GELU: Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function; conv: convolution; convTranspose: transposed convolutional; batch norm: batch normalization;
STFT: Short Time Fourier Transform; ACC: Accelerometry; PPG: Photoplethysmography
